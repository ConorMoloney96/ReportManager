This is a group project that I worked on with 3 of my classmates for the Programming 2 module in second semester. I was mostly responsible 
for the developerSalesReport and gameSalesReport methods however I had to read over and understand the rest of the code in the program so that I could 
effectively integrate my parts. I also worked on debugging the project as a whole which was a joint effort by everyone in the group.

The object of this project was to write a program which would be able to handle records relating to the sale of videogames using the concepts of 
object oriented programming. The main program has a file handling function that allows it to process records relating to videogame sales 
and store the information appropriately. Examples of these files are provided in the project. After scanning the files and storing the information
this program then provides the end user with a variety of different reports to choose from.

When running this project from the command line the user should enter the line "java ReportManager contacts.txt" to pass the contacts.txt file
(included in the project folder) as an argument to the main method of the project. This is a demonstration file to show how the project works.
